## The rules are not complicated :

##### 1) After starting a game, in console will appear one random number

##### 2) You need to type this number

##### 3) If you typed right number, the game will continue, and the next number will show

##### 4) Then, you need to type two numbers, previous and current number

##### 5) The game will go on up to the first mistake

## Programm code, simple as rules:

```python
# Initialize os, random modules
import os
import random

print("Welcome to game: 'Numbers'!")


# endless loop, we want to wait until user`s answer is 'start'
while True:
    print("""
        Type 'start' to start the game
        Type 'help' to see game info and rules
        Type 'exit' to leave the game
    """)

    # user input variabe
    command = input('->')

    # We will break our loop only when variabe 'command' uquals 'start'
    if command == 'start':
        break
    # By entering this command we can see game rules
    elif command == 'help':
        print("""
